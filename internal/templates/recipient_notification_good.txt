Subject: Don’t Take Credit for What You Didn’t Do

Dear [Recipient Name],

My name is [User First Name] [User Last Name], and I’m one of your constitutents. I wanted to reach out because I saw the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and for once, there’s a little good news.

According to the data, [Threshold Name] has decreased by [Change Percentage]%, making things slightly easier for working people.

But let’s be honest—you and your party had nothing to do with it.

Republicans have spent years insisting that cutting taxes for the wealthy, deregulating big business, and slashing social programs is the way to “fix” the economy. But when prices go down or wages go up, it’s never because of Republican policies—it’s because the economy operates despite your obstruction, not because of your leadership.

So before I hear one more speech, tweet, or press release about how you “delivered” this, let’s be clear:

- The free market does what it does, no thanks to you.  
- The policies you push only ever make things harder for working families.  
- You still owe your constituents real solutions, not talking points.  

Instead of pretending this was your doing, why not take actual steps to make sure things keep improving?

I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,  
[User First Name] [User Last Name]
